# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Attached are public links to the color palettes requested.

Explanation of your color choices: Custom Laptops are all about speed so I decided to go with a yellow or red approch.  I then went to Razor's website, saw they used yellow, and from there made a yellow palette.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: Since we're going natural organic foods I could go with colors that make us think of fruit, or nature.  After looking at a few of the sites most of them opted for nature tones, greens and browns, so I went with that.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.
