# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Attached are public links to the color palettes requested.

Explanation of your color choices: Custom Laptops are all about speed so I decided to go with a yellow or red approch.  I then went to Razor's website, saw they used yellow, and from there made a yellow palette.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: Since we're going natural organic foods I could go with colors that make us think of fruit, or nature.  After looking at a few of the sites most of them opted for nature tones, greens and browns, so I went with that.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: I did a little diging and while yellow/gold is the color of wealth, most banking websites are primarily shades of blue to try and calm peaple and help them feel at ease when the manage their money.  Due to this I chose a color palette that is 3 blue and 2 yellow/gold.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.
