# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Useable and gets the job done.

* Behavioral: It gets the job done, although it's not dependable enough that I'll won't always be ready for it to break.

* Reflective: I've had to break before and I live with the break and I'm always ready for it to compleatly break and that I'll need to get a new one.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.Black is almost always an ok color to pick for design.
2.When one part of the object (website) breaks it causes distrust for the entire website.
3. Funtionality goes before athestetics but athestetics can't be ignored.
