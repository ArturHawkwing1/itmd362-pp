# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Useable and gets the job done.

* Behavioral: It gets the job done, although it's not dependable enough that I'll won't always be ready for it to break.

* Reflective: I've had to break before and I live with the break and I'm always ready for it to compleatly break and that I'll need to get a new one.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1.Black is almost always an ok color to pick for design.
